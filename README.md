# Default [Tango!](http://tango.freedesktop.org/) icons as XPM

Hey there! :)

Just in case anyone ever needs these, I've converted the default
Tango! 32x32 icons to XPM format. They are optimized to be linked
together, the color codes repeat themselves so that they may be
[pooled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/690176).

(They are on public domain. Rejoice!)
