# Default [Tango!](http://tango.freedesktop.org/) icons as XPM

Hey there! :)

Just in case anyone ever needs these, I've converted the default
Tango! 32x32 icons to XPM format. They are optimized to be linked
together, the color codes repeat themselves so that they may be
[pooled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/690176).

*This might not work on some systems*: I used RGBA colors (in hex
format as #RRGGBBAA), which is non-standard. ImageMagick seems to
understand the alpha channel correctly, though.

(They are on public domain. Rejoice!)
